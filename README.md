The main purpose of this repository is to help everyone who wants to develop in the de field by providing examples of small projects that I have completed and that I am currently working on. 

The repository has several projects related to:

  - MongoDB; 
  - Pandas; 
  - Clickhouse.


How to Use the Project

To work with the examples of projects that are given in this repository, you need:
  - docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ to run examples related to scripts that are dedicated to working with Clickhouse, MongoDB (these scrips have click and mongo prefixes in the name,             respectively);
  - installed Pandas lib: https://pypi.org/project/pandas/ to try simple ETL scripts (with Pandas prefix in file name of the scripts);
  - installed PySpark lib: https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/ to run the code examples (with PySpark prefix in file name of the scripts).

In addition, to work with scripts with click and mongo prefixes, you need to install:
